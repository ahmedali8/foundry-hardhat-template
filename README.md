## Getting Started

Click the [`Use this template`](https://github.com/ahmedali8/foundry-hardhat-template/generate)
button at the top of the page to create a new repository with this repo as the initial state.

Or, if you prefer to install the template manually:

```sh
$ forge init my-project --template https://github.com/ahmedali8/foundry-hardhat-template
$ cd my-project
$ make setup
```

If this is your first time with Foundry, check out the
[installation](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry#installation) instructions.

## Features

This template builds upon the frameworks and libraries mentioned above, so for details about their
specific features, please consult their respective documentations.

For example, for Hardhat, you can refer to the [Hardhat Tutorial](https://hardhat.org/tutorial) and
the [Hardhat Docs](https://hardhat.org/docs). You might be in particular interested in reading the
[Testing Contracts](https://hardhat.org/tutorial/testing-contracts) section.

For example, for Foundry, you can refer to the [Foundry Book](https://book.getfoundry.sh/). You
might be in particular interested in reading the
[Writing Tests](https://book.getfoundry.sh/forge/writing-tests.html) guide.

### Sensible Defaults

This template comes with sensible default configurations in the following files:

```text
├── .commitlintrc.yml
├── .editorconfig
├── .eslintignore
├── .eslintrc.yml
├── .gitignore
├── .prettierignore
├── .prettierrc.yml
├── .solcover.js
├── .solhintignore
├── .solhint.json
├── .yarnrc.yml
├── foundry.toml
├── hardhat.config.ts
└── remappings.txt
```

### GitHub Actions

This template comes with GitHub Actions pre-configured. Your contracts will be linted and tested on
every push and pull request made to the `main` branch.

Note though that by default it injects `.env.example` env variables into github action's
`$GITHUB_ENV`.

You can edit the CI script in [.github/workflows/ci.yml](./.github/workflows/ci.yml).

### Conventional Commits

This template enforces the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) standard for
git commit messages. This is a lightweight convention that creates an explicit commit history, which
makes it easier to write automated tools on top of.

### Git Hooks

This template uses [Husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) to run automated checks on commit
messages, and [Lint Staged](https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged) to automatically format the code
with Prettier when making a git commit.

# Usage

### Lint Solidity

Lint the Solidity code:

```sh
$ yarn lint:sol
```

## Hardhat

### Pre Requisites

Before running any command, you need to create a `.env` file and set all necessary environment
variables. Follow the example in `.env.example`. You can either use mnemonic or individual private
keys by setting

```sh
$ ACCOUNT_TYPE="MNEMONIC" (Default)
or
$ ACCOUNT_TYPE="PRIVATE_KEYS"
```

If you don't already have a mnemonic, use this [mnemonic-website](https://iancoleman.io/bip39/) to
generate one Or if you don't already have a private key, use this
[privatekey-website](https://vanity-eth.tk/) to generate one.

Then, proceed with installing dependencies:

```sh
$ yarn install
```

### Run a Hardhat chain

To run a local network with all your contracts in it, run the following:

```sh
$ yarn chain
```

### Compile

Compile the smart contracts with Hardhat:

```sh
$ yarn compile
```

### TypeChain

Compile the smart contracts and generate TypeChain bindings:

```sh
$ yarn typechain
```

### Test

Run the tests with Hardhat:

```sh
$ yarn test

or

$ yarn test:gas         # shows gas report and contract size

or

$ yarn test:trace       # shows logs + calls

or

$ yarn test:fulltrace   # shows logs + calls + sloads + sstores
```

Optional:

- See the actual fiat currency rates by setting your coingecko api key from
  [here](https://coinmarketcap.com/api/pricing/) in `.env` file or command.

- Set custom gas price (gwei) in `.env` file or command or let it automatically fetched by
  ethgasstationapi.

```sh
$ GAS_PRICE=20
$ COIN_MARKET_CAP_API_KEY="your_api_key"
```

### Lint TypeScript

Lint the TypeScript code:

```sh
$ yarn lint:ts
```

### Forking mainnet

Starts a local hardhat chain with the state of the last `mainnet` block

```sh
$ yarn fork
```

### Coverage

Generate the code coverage report:

```sh
$ yarn coverage
```

### Clean

Delete the smart contract artifacts, the coverage reports and the Hardhat cache:

```sh
$ yarn clean
```

### Deploy

Deploy the contracts to Hardhat Network:

```sh
$ yarn deploy
```

Deploy the contracts to a specific network, such as the Rinkeby testnet:

```sh
$ yarn deploy:network rinkeby
```

For more information on deploy check out repo
[hardhat-deploy](https://github.com/wighawag/hardhat-deploy)

### Generate Natspec Doc

Generate natspec documentation for your contracts by running

```sh
$ yarn hardhat dodoc
```

For more information on Natspec
[click here](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.12/natspec-format.html#natspec) and for dodoc
repo [click here](https://github.com/primitivefinance/primitive-dodoc)

### View Contracts Size

```sh
$ yarn hardhat size-contracts
```

or turn on for every compile

```sh
$ CONTRACT_SIZER=true
```

## Verify Contract

### Manual Verify

```sh
$ yarn hardhat verify --network <network> DEPLOYED_CONTRACT_ADDRESS "Constructor argument 1" "Constructor argument 2"
```

For complex arguments you can refer
[here](https://hardhat.org/plugins/nomiclabs-hardhat-etherscan.html)

```sh
$ yarn hardhat verify --contract contracts/CONTRACT_NAME.sol:CONTRACT_NAME --network <network> --constructor-args arguments.js DEPLOYED_CONTRACT_ADDRESS
```

### Verify Contract Programmatically

Verify the contract using `verifyContract` function in [verify.ts](./utils/verify.ts)

Set block explorer api key in `.env` file or using command, refer to `.env.example` for more
insight.

Example deploy script with `verifyContract` function is
[00_deploy_lock_contract.ts](./deploy/00_deploy_lock_contract.ts)

## Foundry

Here's a list of the most frequently needed commands.

### Build or Compile

Build the contracts:

```sh
$ forge build
```

### Coverage

Get a test coverage report:

```sh
$ forge coverage
```

### Clean

Delete the build artifacts and cache directories:

```sh
$ forge clean
```

### Deploy

Deploy to Anvil:

```sh
$ anvil
```

Update your .env file with a private key given to you by Anvil.

```sh
# To load the variables in the .env file
$ source .env

# To deploy and verify our contract
$ forge script sol_script/Lock.s.sol:LockScript \
  --fork-url http://localhost:8545 \
  --broadcast \
  --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY \
  -vvvv
```

For instructions on how to deploy to a testnet or mainnet, check out the
[Solidity Scripting tutorial](https://book.getfoundry.sh/tutorials/solidity-scripting.html).

### Gas Usage

Get a gas report:

```sh
$ forge test --gas-report
```

### Test

Run the tests:

```sh
$ forge test
```

You can also use
[console.log](https://book.getfoundry.sh/faq?highlight=console.log#how-do-i-use-consolelog), whose
logs you can see in the terminal output by adding the `-vvvv` flag.

## Notes

1. Foundry piggybacks off [git submodules](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules) to
   manage dependencies. There's a [guide](https://book.getfoundry.sh/projects/dependencies.html)
   about how to work with dependencies in the book.
2. You don't have to create a `.env` file, but filling in the environment variables may be useful
   when debugging and testing against a mainnet fork.

## Syntax Highlighting

If you use VSCode, you can enjoy syntax highlighting for your Solidity code via the
[vscode-solidity](https://github.com/juanfranblanco/vscode-solidity) extension.

## Using GitPod

[GitPod](https://www.gitpod.io/) is an open-source developer platform for remote development.

To view the coverage report generated by `yarn coverage`, just click `Go Live` from the status bar
to turn the server on/off.
